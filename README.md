# Background Context
This project is meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should pair program for at least the mandatory part.

## Resources
<b>Read or watch:<b>

- Sorting algorithm
- Big O notation
- Sorting algorithms animations
- 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
